First of all you need to install these Python Libraries and Frameworks:
1. OpenCV (cv2): Used for video capture, frame processing, and displaying the output (computer vision tasks).
2. Dlib: A toolkit used for face detection, shape prediction, and face recognition models.
3. NumPy (numpy): Used for numerical operations, especially for handling face embeddings and calculating distances.
4. pickle: Used for loading the pre-trained known_encodings.pkl file.
5. time: Used for managing the frame rate and timing operations.

And Dlib Pre-trained Models (Data Files):
1. shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
2. dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat

Now follow these steps -
Step 1: Create folder with the name of the person you're try to recognize.
Step 2: Add clear face pictures of the person you're try to recognize.
Step 3: Copy the code from "new faces.txt" file and paste it on face_recognition.py
Step 4: Run the code once.
Step 5: Now copy the code from "face recognition.txt" file and paste it on face_recognition.py
Step 6. Run the code and wait for your web cam to open.
